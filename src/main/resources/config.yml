# anything closely related to a player logging
# in. For example wether or not to block Tor
# A popular anonymization proxy.

#   seconds.
#  LoginFailureWhiteList - How many times
#   a LoginTimeBetweenLogin isn't met before
#   applying a whitelist/ban. Basically how
#   many violations before throwing up a
#   whitelist/banning people. Note: Doesn't
